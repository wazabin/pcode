//! The vocabulary types shared between a p-code *producer* and a p-code
//! *consumer*.
//!
//! A SLEIGH specification describes memory spaces, processor registers and
//! user-defined p-code operations; an IR built from that specification refers
//! to the same things. Both sides need to agree on how those are identified, so
//! the definitions live here rather than in either crate — which lets the
//! decoder and the IR depend on each other only through this vocabulary.
//!
//! These types appear directly in precompiled specification blobs, so their
//! serialized form is part of the producer/consumer compatibility contract.
//! A producer must version its blob format; serde alone does not provide a
//! cross-version or cross-platform wire-format guarantee.
